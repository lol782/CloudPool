# Overview

CloudPool is an open-source **Developer Infrastructure Orchestration Platform** designed to unify backend services into a single programmable infrastructure layer.

Rather than replacing existing cloud providers, CloudPool orchestrates and abstracts infrastructure components through a centralized control plane capable of:

- Dynamic database provisioning
- Hybrid storage pooling
- Embedded vector indexing
- Infrastructure state versioning
- Secure local-to-cloud connectivity
- Native Rust acceleration via JNI

The platform combines the flexibility of **Spring Boot orchestration** with the execution performance of **Rust-native extensions**.

---

# Core Features

## Infrastructure Orchestration

- Dynamic PostgreSQL provisioning
- Redis cache orchestration
- Embedded H2 development environments
- Multi-tenant infrastructure isolation
- Unified infrastructure control layer

---

## Hybrid Storage Pooling

- External storage provider integration
- Local fallback storage engine
- Expirable access token management
- Distributed storage abstraction

Supported providers include:

- Google Drive
- Local disk storage

---

## Native Rust Performance Layer

Critical execution paths are implemented in Rust and exposed through JNI:

- SHA-256 hashing
- zstd / Gzip compression
- Vector mathematics
- Cosine similarity search
- Zero-copy transformations

---

## Dynamic Provisioning Engine

- Runtime schema generation
- Dynamic table creation
- Raw SQL execution
- Live infrastructure mutation
- Runtime reconfiguration

---

## Infrastructure Rollback & Versioning

- Snapshot-based state tracking
- Infrastructure history auditing
- Schema version management
- Real-time rollback support

---

## Embedded Vector Search

- Native Weaviate integration
- Semantic text chunk indexing
- Local vector fallback engine
- Rust-powered cosine similarity

---

# System Architecture

CloudPool follows a hybrid polyglot architecture optimized for orchestration flexibility and native execution performance.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Install the following dependencies:

* Java JDK 17 or 21
* Rust 1.70+
* Cargo
* Maven

---

# Build Instructions

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Charvaka/CloudPool.git

cd CloudPool
```

---

## 2. Compile Native Rust Module

```bash
cd backend/rust

cargo build --release
```

Generated binaries will appear inside:

```text
target/release/
```

Examples:

* `.dll` → Windows
